Project aims to support Python 3.9+ and Django 2.2+.

For **Django < 2.0** version support or **python-2.x** compatibility, please use version **1.3.4** which is
the last version to support **python-2.x** compatibility.

For **Django 2.0/2.1** version support or **Python 3.5/3.6** compatibility, please use version **1.5.7** which is
the last version to support **Django 2.0/2.1** and **Python 3.5/3.6** compatibility.

This django library is just a lightweight wrapper on `Select2` library
and provides easy-to-use basic select2 functionality in a django project.
If you need feature-rich solution, i recommend you to look at the latest
django-select2_ library, which have ajax loading support.

If anyone really wants this functionality in django-easy-select2,
please feel free to contribute.

How it looks
------------

Select one of existing values with single-valued choice field
(ForeignKeyField, for example):

    :target: https://github.com/asyncee/django-easy-select2/raw/master/screenshots/select2_single.png

Easily select 1 or more "categories" for your project, you can also
add a new one in the normal, Django-Admin manner by using the
green + button with multiple-valued choice field (ManyToManyField):

Quickstart
----------

In your admin.py:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from easy_select2 import select2_modelform
    from polls.models import Poll

    PollForm = select2_modelform(Poll, attrs={'width': '250px'})

    class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = PollForm


Thats all. All your choice widgets are select2 widgets 250px wide.
